### Hi! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Trevor and Iâ€™m an imaginative software engineer with over 20 years working in technology. Having previously designed and implemented reliable, fast and secure Cisco networks, I am now building full stack web applications and neat games in JS/React/Node/Rails/Firebase and C#/Unity. Checkout my portfolio @ https://trevorsmithholbourn.xyz and grab my resume or get in touch. I'd love to help you build your next cool thing.
